# Project - Animal Shelter

A dog shelter has requested an app that can track dogs for rehoming. An owner may reserve more than one dog. A dog is reserved by only one owner.

## MVP

Important information for the shelter to know is:
* For the dog:
    * Name
    * Owner
* For the owner:
    * Name
    * Email address
    * Contact number
    * Dog (if reserved)
* Allow an owner to reserve a dog (assign a dog to an owner)
* CRUD actions for dogs / owners - remember the user - what would they want to see on each View? What Views should there be?

Possible Extensions:

* Add age, breed and size to dogs.
* Add a short bio for dogs.
* Add an availability status for dogs. Which dogs are available and which are reserved?
* Add characteristics to dogs and preferences to owners. List potential dog matches for owners.

* Add more types of animal.
* Record donations from owners.
